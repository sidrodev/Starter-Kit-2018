# Starter-Kit-2018

So this was built for all the new web developers... The Goal is to save you time from the bullsh*t of spending hours looking for ways to speed up your learning. Sometimes all we want to do is just code.
(if you are coming from CodingPhase's  [youtube channel CodingPhase](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46wWUso9H5KPQcoL9iE3Ug) many of our tutorials will be based on this starter kit)

This is broken down in simple steps to get you going.
